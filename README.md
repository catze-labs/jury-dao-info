## Overview
JuryDAO is built on the EVM and is powered by smart contracts. It uses a decentralized governance model, where stakeholders can vote on proposals and decisions are made based on the consensus of the community. The DAO is powered by the native token named BIT, which can be staked as collateral in dispute resolution cases and used for voting.
​
## Features
- Case creation: Users can create new dispute resolution cases by submitting a title, description, and stake amount.
- Case voting: Users can vote on cases by staking their BIT tokens and indicating their decision.
- Jury selection: The DAO selects a randomly chosen jury from the community members to vote on each case.
- Transparent decision-making: All decisions and votes are recorded on the blockchain and can be audited for transparency.
- Reward system: Users who participated in the dispute resolution process as jurors are rewarded with BIT tokens as an incentive.
- Staking and unstaking: Users can stake and unstake their BIT tokens as collateral for cases, and the tokens are locked during the process.
